🧪 QA Portfolio — Moe Hein Khant

Welcome to my QA Testing portfolio.

I am building a career in software quality with structured testing, clear communication, and reliable results.

I use real test cases, bug reports, and API tests to show how I think, how I test, and how I improve product quality.

🚀 About Me

I am training to become a Junior QA Tester in the UK.

I focus on:
spotting defects early
breaking complex problems into simple steps
writing structured test documentation
improving reliability across systems

My personal background shaped me into a patient, logical, detail-driven problem solver. This matches the demands of QA work.

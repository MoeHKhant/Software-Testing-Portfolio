# 🧪 QA Portfolio — Moe Hein Khant

Welcome to my QA Testing portfolio.  
I’m building a career in software quality by focusing on **structured testing, clear communication, and reliable results**.  

I work with real test cases, bug reports, and API tests to show how I think, how I test, and how I improve product quality.

## 🚀 About Me

I’m training to become a **Junior QA Tester** with a strong focus on:

- spotting issues early  
- breaking complex problems into simple steps  
- writing clean, structured test documentation  
- improving reliability across systems  

My background shaped me into a patient, logical and detail-driven problem solver — the exact mindset required for quality assurance.

## 🎯 Why This Portfolio Matters

I built this portfolio to show how I approach testing:

- I think in steps, not guesses.  
- I document clearly so engineers can fix issues fast.  
- I test like a user but report like a QA.  
- I value reliability above everything.  

This portfolio proves that I’m not just learning QA — **I’m already doing QA.**
